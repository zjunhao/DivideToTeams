# DivideToTeams
A program which helps randomly divide a group of people into two teams


## Detailed description
So you have a group of people and often you want to randomly divide them into two teams, say, you and your friends are playing league of legends and want to divide them to two teams and compete with each other.

Since the freind list doesn't change a lot, you can add all your friend names in SummonerNames.txt with one name each line.

Since this activity happens very often, to avoid add remove names each time when different people shows up, you can add all your friend names inside SummonerNames.txt and suffix name with "-" for the people who are playing this time.

Then you can run the program and it would divide evenly into two teams.

## How to use this program
1. Add all names into "SummonerNames.txt", one name each line.
2. Add people into drawing pool by suffixing '-' to their names.
3. Run python .\RandomNamePicker.py
